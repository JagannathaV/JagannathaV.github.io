        Hi, my name is Jagannatha and I'm an automation Engineer.
  My first introduction to programming was during my engineering and learnt some of the programming languages.
  I've started my first job as a software test engineer in a small startup company, here am solo engineer for automation testing.The environment thought me a lot.
  Since then I've learned various programming languages.
  Presently am working an MNC company and learning new technologies and applied on real time.
  It's always gratifying to help and teach people as well as partaking in a rabbit hole with students because everyone asks different questions that would never occur to me.
      </p>

        I am now looking for my next adventure, so feel free to browse the <a class="about_me_links" href="/projects">projects</a> section to check out what I've built, <a class="about_me_links" href="/contact">shoot me an email</a> or connect on <a class="about_me_links" href="https://linkedin.com/in/jagannatha-mv-56639b7b">linkedIn</a>.
